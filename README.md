A Persian font family for changing the page number in Microsoft Word to Persian or Arabic digits  

In the new version of the Microsoft Office (I mean 2016 or newwer) there is a problem in page digits for Persian and Arabic documents. 

Normally when you want to show the digits in Persian or Arabic douments in the form of Hindi digits you must set the `Numeral` dropdown inside the `Word Options>Advanced` to the `Context`. In the way as soon as you are typing from right to left or with a Persian or Arabic keyboard you will see the digits in a Persian or Hindi form. It means instead of `0123456789` you will see `۰۱۲۳۴۵۶۷۸۹`.

Also in the old version of the Microsoft Word you can see as soon as you set the line to right to left you could see the page number in Persian format. However, it seems in the newer version there is a bug that it does not show the page number in the correct way and almost always show the digits in the western form which is called somehow wrongly Arabic alphabet. The reason for this naming is the the root of the western digits i.e. `0123456789` is from arabic digits that are `۰۱۲۳۴۵۶۷۸۹`.

But how can we resolve this issue? That is easy just instul these `Persian Page Number` font family and change the font of the page number to one of the fonts of this family and then you will see the page number in the form of Persian digits. 

Please note if you use this font for any text you cannot type western digits anymore.
